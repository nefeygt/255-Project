This project is developed using jQuery as a clone of Microsoft's To-Do list.

Adding To-Do Lists:
You can create and delete a To-Do list and add tasks to it. These tasks are stored in local storage.

Completing Tasks:
When you complete a task, you can mark it as done. The number of uncompleted tasks is shown in the left menu.
